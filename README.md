## Overview

CrowdPass is a decentralized event ticketing platform built on the Stellar blockchain that revolutionizes how event organizers create and manage tickets while providing attendees with unprecedented security, transparency, and control over their ticket purchases.

By leveraging Stellar's fast, low-cost transactions and smart contract capabilities (Soroban), CrowdPass eliminates ticket fraud, ensures transparent fund management, and provides automatic refunds for canceled events—all while maintaining a seamless user experience.

## Problem & Solution

### Current Industry Challenges

The event ticketing industry suffers from critical inefficiencies that affect both organizers and attendees:

#### For Event Organizers
- **Ticket Duplication**: Malicious actors can forge or duplicate tickets, undermining event security and revenue
- **Revenue Loss**: Lack of transparent tracking leads to unaccountable funds and potential financial discrepancies
- **Fraud Prevention**: Limited tools to verify ticket authenticity at scale

#### For Event Attendees
- **Counterfeit Tickets**: Risk of purchasing fake tickets from unauthorized resellers
- **Refund Uncertainty**: Difficulty obtaining refunds for canceled or rescheduled events
- **No Ownership Rights**: Inability to securely transfer or resell tickets without risk

### The CrowdPass Solution

CrowdPass addresses these challenges through blockchain-native ticketing:

✅ **Immutable Ticket NFTs** - Each ticket is a unique digital asset on Stellar, making duplication impossible

✅ **Transparent Escrow** - Smart contracts hold funds securely until event completion, protecting both parties

✅ **Automatic Refunds** - Canceled events trigger instant refund distribution to ticket holders

✅ **Secure Secondary Market** - Built-in resale functionality with verified provenance

✅ **Token-Bound Accounts** - Tickets can hold assets, badges, and privileges that transfer with ownership

## Architecture

### Smart Contract Design

CrowdPass utilizes Stellar's Soroban smart contracts to implement:

```

### Key Components

1. **Event Registry**: On-chain record of all events and their parameters
2. **NFT Tickets**: Soroban-based NFTs representing unique ticket ownership
3. **Escrow Contract**: Holds funds with conditional release logic
4. **Token-Bound Implementation**: Tickets function as autonomous accounts
5. **Refund Mechanism**: Automated distribution based on event status

## Smart Contract Functions

### Organizer Functions

- `create_event(params)` - Initialize a new event with ticketing parameters
- `cancel_event(event_id)` - Cancel event and trigger refund process
- `reschedule_event(event_id, new_date)` - Update event timing
- `create_ticket_tier(event_id, tier_params)` - Define ticket types and pricing
- `withdraw_funds(event_id)` - Claim revenue after event completion

### Attendee Functions

- `purchase_ticket(event_id, tier)` - Buy tickets with XLM or supported assets
- `resale_ticket(ticket_id, price)` - List ticket for secondary sale
- `claim_refund(ticket_id)` - Manually trigger refund for canceled events
- `transfer_ticket(ticket_id, recipient)` - Gift or transfer ownership
- `view_ticket_benefits(ticket_id)` - See associated POAPs and perks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools) installed
- [Soroban SDK](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup) configured
- Node.js 18+ for frontend development

### Installation

#### Using Makefile (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/crowdpass-live/tokenbound_impl.git
cd tokenbound_impl

# Setup all dependencies (client and contracts)
make setup

# Build all components
make build
```

#### Using Docker (Local Development)
```bash
# Start all services (Stellar node, Contracts, Frontend)
make docker-up

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f frontend
```

#### Manual Installation
```bash
# Install root dependencies (if any)
npm install

# Build smart contracts
cd soroban-contract
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run frontend
cd ../client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Quick Start Commands
- `make setup` - Install all dependencies
- `make build` - Build contracts and frontend
- `make test` - Run all tests
- `make docker-up` - Spin up local development environment
- `make docker-down` - Stop local environment
- `make lint` - Run linters

### Coverage Reporting

CI publishes coverage reports for the Soroban contracts and the Next.js frontend to Codecov.

- Rust coverage runs with `cargo-llvm-cov` in `soroban-contract`
- Frontend coverage runs with Jest in `soroban-client`
- CI enforces a minimum 70% line coverage floor for both stacks

Run coverage locally with:

```bash
cd soroban-client
npm run test:coverage

cd ../soroban-contract
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --lcov --output-path coverage/lcov.info --fail-under-lines 70
```

## Use Cases

### 🎵 Concert & Festival Ticketing
Eliminate scalping with blockchain-verified tickets and automated royalty payments to artists.

### 🎭 Theater & Performing Arts
Season pass holders receive exclusive NFT badges unlocking backstage content and priority booking.

### 🏟️ Sporting Events
Teams issue commemorative POAPs to ticket holders, building verifiable fan communities.

### 🎓 Conferences & Workshops
Automatic credential NFTs for attendees, serving as proof of participation for professional development.

### 🎪 Community Events
Small organizers access enterprise-grade ticketing without upfront costs or platform fees.

## Security Considerations

- **Audited Contracts**: All smart contracts undergo third-party security audits
- **Multi-Signature Controls**: Critical functions require multiple approvals
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against spam and malicious attacks
- **Escrow Guarantees**: Mathematical proof of fund availability for refunds
- **Privacy Options**: Optional anonymity for ticket purchases
